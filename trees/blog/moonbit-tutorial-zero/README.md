# MoonBit Tutorial from Zero

This tutorial is designed for **complete beginners** with no prior programming experience. It introduces the MoonBit programming language in a clear, step-by-step manner with detailed explanations and real-world examples.

## Why This Tutorial?

The current official MoonBit guide assumes the learners are familiarity with programming or functional languages. It may be approachable for those who already know a first language like C, Python, or Java. However, it's **not well-suited for true beginners**.

This project aims to fill that gap by offering a **textbook-style tutorial**, written in plain language, with rich examples and incremental learning, helping non-programmers truly understand how to think and build with MoonBit.

## Goals

- **Zero to One**: No coding background is required.
- **Structured Learning**: Concepts are introduced gradually, with increasing complexity.
- **Code-Driven**: Each concept is paired with practical code examples.
- **Hands-On**: Readers will build small but meaningful projects throughout the course.
