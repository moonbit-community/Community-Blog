Fast 33%?

We are just a group of programming language enthusiasts, and the audience for this FFT report may not be us, but at least we cannot be fooled.

The current attitude of Community Blog is that it does not recognize the results of Benchmark FFT in MoonBit's latest promotion and will not publish them in Weekly.

This blog will not be deleted until there is a reasonable response from the official.
