The MoonBit Community Blog is an unofficial community website for MoonBit initiated and overseen by Lampese, primarily operated by the PLCT J139 team, and open to community contributions. It aims to enhance community interaction, synchronize community updates, introduce MoonBit to a broader audience, and foster the development of the MoonBit language.

We greatly need the help of community members to maintain and improve the Community-Blog. Specific contribution methods and standards can be found in the [Contribution Guide](contribution.md).
