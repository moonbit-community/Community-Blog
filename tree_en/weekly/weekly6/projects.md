title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- [AdUhTkJm Yue Huang](https://github.com/AdUhTkJm) implemented a MoonBit compiler [moonc](https://github.com/AdUhTkJm/moonc) using MoonBit. He manually developed all passes from Lexer/Parser to the interpreter. Currently, the compiler can fully parse itself. This project can also be used independently as a package on [mooncakes.io](https://mooncakes.io).
- [BigOrangeQWQ](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ/BigOrangeQWQ) modified the community project [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/peter-jerry-ye/wit-bindgen) into a new project [wit-cli-example](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ/wit-cli-example). The modified wit-bindgen only generates interfaces for the current package, while other packages are added as dependencies in the `deps` field and referenced as external dependencies. The MoonBit toolchain automatically manages unused import functions, then exports only the functions requiring implementation. The project is still in its early stages.
- [FlyCloudC](https://github.com/FlyCloudC) developed a [Scheme](https://github.com/FlyCloudC/scheme) interpreter. Primarily for educational purposes, this project focuses on code readability rather than extensive optimizations.
- [chenbimo 陈随易](https://github.com/chenbimo) created a MoonBit development portal [moonbit.dev](https://moonbit.dev), currently featuring only a homepage. The GitHub repository is at [chenbimo/moonbit.dev](https://github.com/chenbimo/moonbit.dev).
- MoonBit core team member [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) built a Unicode property table generator [unicode_tablegen](https://github.com/myfreess/unicode_tablegen). This tool automatically generates Unicode character property determination functions and test cases, supporting command-line and Python script execution to produce corresponding MoonBit code and data tables. It facilitates efficient Unicode property handling in compilers, interpreters, and similar scenarios.
