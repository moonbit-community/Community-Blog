- [BigOrangeQWQ](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ) developed a MoonBit LLDB debug extension [moonbit_native_debug_script](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ/moonbit_native_debug_script), which adds specialized MoonBit symbol viewing and debugging commands to LLDB through Python scripts. This project provides commands such as `mbt_symbols`, `mbt_bp`, and `mbt_bps`, supporting MoonBit symbol listing, breakpoint setting, and breakpoint management capabilities.
