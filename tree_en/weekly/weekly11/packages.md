title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [CGaaaaaa](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa) developed [moonbit-url](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa/moonbit-url), an RFC 3986-compliant URI parsing and manipulation library for MoonBit. This library provides comprehensive URI parsing, normalization, reference resolution, and percent-encoding capabilities, with support for IPv6 addresses, file operations, and query parameter management. Documentation for individual APIs is currently not yet fully documented.  
- [GreatHank](https://github.com/GreatHank) created [regression-tools](https://github.com/GreatHank/regression-tools), a regression analysis library for MoonBit. It offers multiple regression algorithms, including machine learning models such as logistic regression. The regression tools are primarily used for data analysis and predictive modeling, enabling developers to build and train regression models for numerical prediction and classification tasks. The project is currently in the early stages of development.
