---

- [illusory0x0](https://github.com/illusory0x0) (猗露) open-sourced a project [clang](https://github.com/moonbit-community/clang.mbt), a native binding library for libclang designed for C/C++ code analysis. It provides AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) capabilities for MoonBit developers via Clang's C interface. The project is still in progress.
- MoonBit core team member [Kaida-Amethyst](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst), also the author of [llvm.mbt](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/llvm.mbt), created a new project [Aether](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/Aether) as a demo of MoonBit SSA.
- MoonBit core team member [Young-Flash](https://github.com/Young-Flash) developed a block-based MoonBit code generation project [moonbit-blockly](https://github.com/Young-Flash/moonbit-blockly), representing an interesting attempt at visual programming, though it is still rough at this stage.
- [oboard](https://github.com/oboard) developed a weather query tool [weatherquery](https://github.com/oboard/weatherquery) using MoonBit, which can retrieve real-time weather information for specified cities.
