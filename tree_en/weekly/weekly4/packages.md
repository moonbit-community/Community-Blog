title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [kesmeey](https://github.com/kesmeey) developed the [immut_BitVector](https://github.com/moonbit-community/immut_BitVector) library for compactly and efficiently storing and manipulating boolean sequences. It provides a series of bit operations while maintaining immutability, with all modification operations returning new instances.
- MoonBit official member [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) developed a Unicode CaseFold library [casefold](https://github.com/myfreess/casefold) for MoonBit, which can perform fuzzy matching of Unicode.
- [xunyoyo](https://github.com/xunyoyo) developed an ML-KEM algorithm implementation library [moonkem](https://github.com/moonbit-community/moonkem) for MoonBit, currently in the early stages of development.
- [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) developed a command-line argument parsing library [options](https://github.com/Milky2018/options). This library is based on JSON format, supports flexible command-line argument parsing, and is currently an experimental project.
- [蓝莓小果冻 Bemly](https://github.com/Bemly) developed a MoonBit binding library [mbt-cstdio-ffi](https://github.com/Bemly/mbt-cstdio-ffi) for C standard library I/O. This library connects the C language's stdio standard input/output interfaces with MoonBit via FFI, fully adheres to C's resource management rules, does not include garbage collection, all file streams must be manually released, and is suitable for scenarios requiring low-level I/O control.
