title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [GrankHank](https://github.com/GreatHank) developed a [mutable BitVector library](https://github.com/GreatHank/moonbit-BitVector) using a 32-bit packed implementation that supports various bitwise operations. It has passed the PLCT Lab's final output certification.  
- [RuifengFu](https://github.com/RuifengFu) created a [Diff library for MoonBit](https://github.com/moonbit-community/diff), inspired by Rust's [similar-crates](https://crates.io/crates/similar) project. Unlike existing community libraries, this Diff library supports comparisons across multiple data structures and features well-designed documentation and APIs. It is now functionally complete but hasn't yet applied for PLCT Lab output certification.  
- [kesmeey](https://github.com/kesmeey) implemented an efficient [IntervalTree](https://github.com/moonbit-community/IntervalTree) library supporting various interval operations. Basic functionalities are complete, including creation, addition/deletion/modification/query, traversal, size/capacity retrieval, array conversion, indexing, and generic support. Currently in early development.  
- [ZSeanYves](https://github.com/ZSeanYves) built [BufferUtils](https://github.com/ZSeanYves/BufferUtils), a high-performance buffering utility library for MoonBit inspired by Rust's [BufReader](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html) and [BufWriter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufWriter.html). It enables efficient, flexible, and composable buffered I/O with comprehensive error handling and multi-type compatibility. Has passed PLCT Lab's Phase 1 output certification.  
- [0Ayachi0](https://github.com/0Ayachi0) developed a [SwissTable](https://github.com/moonbit-community/SwissTable) library implementing a hash table based on SwissTable principles. Core features include creation, addition/deletion/modification/query, traversal, size/capacity retrieval, emptiness checks, and array conversion. Currently in initial stages.  
- [xunyoyo](https://github.com/xunyoyo) created [NyaNBT](https://github.com/moonbit-community/NyaNBT), a MoonBit-based NBT file parsing library supporting NBT read/write operations with rich APIs for NBT data manipulation. Though in early development, it marks a promising start for MoonBit's ecosystem in game plugins and related tools.  
- [ryota0624](https://github.com/ryota0624) authored [moonbit-router](https://github.com/ryota0624/moonbit-router), an HTTP routing library for MoonBit referencing Rust's [routerify](https://github.com/routerify/routerify). Currently in initial development phase.  
- [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) developed [moonchor](https://github.com/Milky2018/moonchor), a Choreographic Programming library for MoonBit. This interesting small project enables collaborative operations through choreographic programming paradigms.  
- MoonBit official team member [tonyfettes](https://github.com/tonyfettes) released [bearssl.mbt](https://github.com/tonyfettes/bearssl.mbt), MoonBit bindings for BearSSL. This library integrates BearSSL cryptographic functions into MoonBit via FFI, providing secure encrypted communication capabilities suitable for SSL/TLS-enabled application development.
