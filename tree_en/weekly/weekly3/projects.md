title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- This week, with the refinement and official release of rabbit-tea, MoonBit official member [Yoorkin](https://github.com/Yoorkin) open-sourced two new repositories in MoonBit-Community: [rabbit-tea-template](https://github.com/moonbit-community/rabbit-tea-template) and [rabbit-tea-vite](https://github.com/moonbit-community/rabbit-tea-vite). The former is a template repository based on rabbit-tea, while the latter is a Vite plugin for rabbit-tea.
- [illusory0x0 猗露](https://github.com/illusory0x0) developed a new project [qpainter](https://github.com/moonbit-community/qpainter.mbt), a MoonBit-based drawing library binding to C++'s QPainter library, supporting various shapes and text rendering. This library serves as an excellent demonstration of C++ bindings, showcasing advanced closure handling techniques.
- MoonBit official member [Kaida-Amethyst](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst) developed a new project [matplotlib.mbt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/matplotlib.mbt) based on their own [python.mbt](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/python.mbt), providing bindings for Python's matplotlib library. As MoonBit's first Python binding library, it signals promising growth in Python binding ecosystems.
- [hanbings](https://github.com/hanbings) created a JIT-enabled Brainfuck interpreter [yuanchu](https://github.com/hanbings/yuanchu). While the language is simple, the JIT implementation presents a novel approach.
- Students from Wenzhou-Kean University—[Lampese 东灯](https://github.com/Lampese), [李博源](https://github.com/LilJordan23), and [邓子辉](https://github.com/orgs/WKU-LLM-Collections/people/dengjihui1)—collaboratively developed [MoonBit-Docs-VectorDB](https://github.com/WKU-LLM-Collections/MoonBit-Docs-VectorDB). They constructed a vector database using context-augmented MoonBit official documentation, with the initial version now open-sourced. Future plans include detailed modeling of mooncakes.io and other codebases.
- [kamome RINNE-TAN](https://github.com/RINNE-TAN) developed a Multi-Stage Programming toy compiler using MoonBit. Recently enhanced with documentation and demos, its high code quality makes it an exemplary community implementation of MoonBit's portable compiler.
- MoonBit official member [lijunchen](https://github.com/lijunchen) open-sourced [moonbit-eps32](https://github.com/moonbit-community/moonbit-esp32) in the community, providing bindings for MoonBit Native backend on ESP32 development boards. With comprehensive documentation and demos, it's ready for embedded development.
- [illusory0x0 猗露](https://github.com/illusory0x0) open-sourced [moonbit-native-ffi-examples](https://github.com/illusory0x0/moonbit-native-ffi-examples), a collection demonstrating Native FFI implementations using MoonBit.
- MoonBit official member [lijunchen](https://github.com/lijunchen) developed [mvm](https://github.com/lijunchen/mvm), enabling rapid switching of MoonBit toolchain between Stable, Pre-Release, and Bleeding versions.
- MoonBit official member [tonyfettes](https://github.com/tonyfettes) open-sourced a new repository [openssl.mbt](https://github.com/tonyfettes/openssl.mbt), intended to bind Python's OpenSSL-related libraries, though currently incomplete.
- [Yang Ming-Tian skylee03](https://github.com/skylee03) implemented a toy programming language [citysub](https://github.com/skylee03/citysub) using MoonBit, supporting multiple bounded quantification mechanisms—a significant exploration of MoonBit in symbolic computation.
