- Meetup Chengdu Station

  On April 26, MoonBit successfully hosted a Meetup at Jihuo Lab in Chengdu, Sichuan! This event focused on [Basic Software in the AI Era](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Z27YZ00FVWsMivety3-IUg), inviting multiple industry experts to explore cutting-edge technologies and development trends.
  
  The agenda featured four insightful technical presentations:
  
  - Zhang Hongbo (Chief Scientist at IDEA Research Institute & MoonBit Team Lead) analyzed the current state of domestic programming languages and opportunities under the AI wave;
  - Ma Fajun (Professor-level Senior Engineer at Kylin Software & Ecosystem Partnership Lead at openKylin Community) shared intelligent OS technologies and practices for AIPC;
  - Fei Haoxiang (Core Engineer at MoonBit) demonstrated MoonBit's innovative advantages in AI Agent development;
  - Dong Pengfei (Founder & CEO of Chongqing Weizhe Technology) explored future directions of programming languages in the AI context.

  Beyond showcasing MoonBit's latest advancements, this event provided a platform for community engagement. Thought-provoking questions from the audience sparked extensive discussions, fostering active interaction and knowledge sharing within the developer community.
  
- MoonBit Official Weekly Update (April 21) was released, primarily focusing on language enhancements:
  - New `async` function syntax `f!(..)` adopted; original `f!!(..)` now triggers warnings.
  - Operator overloading migrated to `trait`-based approach. Legacy methods remain usable but emit compiler warnings. Migration requires replacing `op_xxx` with corresponding `trait impl`.
  - Default `trait` method implementations: Added `= _` marker to improve source code readability.
  - `String` type conversion: Now supports implicit conversion to `@string.View`, with restored `[:]` syntax for full view retrieval.
  - `Core API` changes: Parameter types in `@string` package migrated to `@string.View`; return types adjusted accordingly.
  - Toolchain optimizations: IDE now supports debug breakpoints in `.mbt.md` files; `moon.mod.json` adds build script fields.

  In frontend development, MoonBit is driving revolutionary changes. Inspired by Elm's purely functional architecture, MoonBit created the [Rabbit-TEA](https://github.com/moonbit-community/rabbit-tea) framework. Leveraging unidirectional data flow and strong typing, it eliminates runtime exceptions while delivering concise and robust web application development.
  
  MoonBit enhances coding efficiency through pattern matching and immutable variables. Compared to JavaScript, MoonBit code is more compact and logically clearer, especially for complex business logic. Its compiler supports multi-backend output (JavaScript, WebAssembly, native), enabling broad application prospects.
  
  Rabbit-TEA adopts the classic TEA architecture (Model-View-Update), driving state updates through message passing. Building a counter app only requires defining state models, message types, and update logic – the framework handles view updates automatically, dramatically boosting productivity. Its HTML EDSL prevents string misuse through type hints, reducing potential errors.
  
  For side-effect management, Rabbit-TEA utilizes Elm-inspired Cmd types to encapsulate external interactions, ensuring runtime state consistency. HTTP requests or browser API calls are safely managed via Cmd.
  
  Thanks to MoonBit's global Dead Code Elimination (DCE), Rabbit-TEA applications are extremely lightweight (e.g., 33KB for a counter app), outperforming mainstream frameworks. The MoonBit team has rewritten the package management site mooncakes.io using this framework and continues to explore advanced features like SSR and time-travel debugging.
  
  A new era of web development has arrived – MoonBit and Rabbit-TEA inject fresh vitality into frontend engineering!
