This is the community weekly report for March 24, 2025 to April 6, 2025, which is a bi-weekly report.

Over the past two weeks, MoonBit officially held an OJ programming competition and the first Meetup event of 2025 in Shenzhen. The number of community contributions has significantly increased, with many high-quality packages from the community emerging, primarily focusing on infrastructure aspects. At the same time, the Community-Blog was officially established, issuing the first Weekly report. (Each title contains a lot of content; click on the title to expand it.)
