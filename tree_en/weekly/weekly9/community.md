It introduces the experience of using MoonBit for compiler development through engaging examples, offering one of the rare comprehensive walkthroughs of the entire compiler development process—from Lexer/Parser to Codegen—using MoonBit.
- Permanent Notice: The PLCT (Programming Language and Compiler Technology) Lab at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, offers MoonBit internship opportunities for current students. Positions include J139 MoonBit Application Development and J147 MoonBit RISC-V Compiler Development, featuring remote work and high flexibility.
