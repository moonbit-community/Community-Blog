title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages

- [Lampese](https://github.com/Lampese) developed [MoonBibLaTeX](https://github.com/Lampese/MoonBibLaTeX), a library for parsing and manipulating BibLaTeX files, supporting both parsing and serialization of BibLaTeX-formatted data. The library is currently well-documented.  
- [edragain](https://github.com/edragain2nd) created [compose](https://github.com/edragain2nd/compose), a library that combines two Unicode characters into a single Precomposed character. This implementation references Rust's `char::compose()`.  
- [edragain](https://github.com/edragain2nd) authored [unscanny](https://github.com/edragain2nd/unscanny), a string scanning library for processing strings in contexts like symbolic computation. Inspired by Rust's [unscanny](https://github.com/typst/unscanny), it serves as an essential component for parsing in the [typst](https://github.com/typst) projectâ€”simple yet critical.  
- MoonBit founder [Professor Zhang Hongbo](https://github.com/bobzhang) implemented a [toml-parser](https://github.com/bobzhang/toml-parser) for parsing TOML markup. Though documentation is still lacking, it demonstrates MoonBit's strengths in symbolic computation.  
- [BigOrangeQWQ](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ) developed a MoonBit URI parsing library [URI.mbt](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ/URI.mbt) using Vibe Coding. While the code appears "not very clever" (as self-described), its documentation is comprehensive. It's noteworthy that Vibe Coding can now deliver a library of this substantial scale end-to-end.
