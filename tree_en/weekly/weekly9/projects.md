- [WilliamZ WilliamZ1008](https://github.com/WilliamZ1008) created a Qt-based MoonBit GUI sample project [moonbit-qt-gui](https://github.com/WilliamZ1008/moonbit-qt-gui). This project demonstrates how to integrate Qt technology for graphical interface development within the MoonBit ecosystem, providing an exploratory example of desktop GUI implementation for MoonBit applications.
