title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [Fangyin Cheng fangyinc](https://github.com/fangyinc) developed a cross-platform (backend) networking package for MoonBit: [net.mbt](https://github.com/fangyinc/net.mbt). It now features comprehensive documentation and supports building simple HTTP servers (currently compatible with Native and JavaScript backends). This represents one of the community's most mature and complete network encapsulation libraries. Complementary infrastructure [socket.mbt](https://github.com/fangyinc/socket.mbt) provides socket binding support.
- [迷渡 justjavac](https://github.com/justjavac) created [moonbit-cache-padded](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-cache-padded), a cache-padded data structure that reduces false sharing in multithreaded applications. Both documentation and implementation are now highly mature.
- [迷渡 justjavac](https://github.com/justjavac) authored [moonbit-core-affinity](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-core-affinity), a library for modifying CPU core affinity to control thread/core binding. It features robust documentation and supports mainstream platforms including Windows/Linux/macOS (Other Unix has limited support).
- [迷渡 justjavac](https://github.com/justjavac) built [moonbit-glob](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-glob), a glob processing library for MoonBit that handles pattern matching with comprehensive glob functionality. Documentation and implementation are exceptionally mature.
- [迷渡 justjavac](https://github.com/justjavac) developed [moonbit-case](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-case), a string case conversion library supporting transformations between `camelCase`, `PascalCase`, `snake_case`, and other naming conventions.
- [AXiX AXiX-official](https://github.com/AXiX-official) implemented [binaryPrimitives](https://github.com/AXiX-official/binaryPrimitives), enabling read/write operations on MoonBit primitive types (excluding BigInt) via `ArrayView[Byte]`. Inspired by C#'s `System.Buffers.Binary.BinaryPrimitives`, it currently achieves high implementation completeness.
- [ryota0624](https://github.com/ryota0624) created [moonbit-mustache](https://github.com/ryota0624/moonbit-mustache), a Mustache template language processor for MoonBit modeled after Go's [mustache](https://github.com/alexkappa/mustache).
- [CAIMEO](https://github.com/CAIMEOX) authored [vlq](https://github.com/CAIMEOX/vlq), a library for encoding/decoding Variable-Length Quantity (VLQ) and Base64 VLQ with thorough implementation and documentation.
- [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) developed a MoonBit [SQL Parser](https://github.com/Milky2018/sqlparser-mbt) that parses SQL statements, laying groundwork for database-related ecosystem development. Features mature implementation and documentation.
- [SupremeHuaji](https://github.com/SupremeHuaji) implemented an efficient Radix Tree in MoonBit for rapid string key/prefix lookups. Path compression optimizes shared-prefix key sets, excelling in routing tables, autocompletion, and dictionaries. Documentation is comprehensive.
- [SupremeHuaji](https://github.com/SupremeHuaji) created a high-performance [van Emde Boas (VEB) Tree](https://github.com/SupremeHuaji/VEBTree) in MoonBit for integer set operations. It achieves O(log log U) time complexity for insertions, deletions, lookups, predecessor/successor queries, outperforming traditional balanced trees and hash tables for bounded integer ranges.
- [SupremeHuaji](https://github.com/SupremeHuaji) built a simple [MaxStack](https://github.com/SupremeHuaji/MaxStack) using dual-stack design, enabling O(1) maximum value retrieval.
- [HCHogan Hank](https://github.com/HCHogan) developed [sorted_map](https://github.com/HCHogan/btree.mbt) based on BTree implementation. Core features (add/query/delete) are complete. Once documented, this CPU cache-friendly library may replace the AVL Tree-based `sorted_map` in MoonBit's standard library.
