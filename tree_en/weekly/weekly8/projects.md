title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- [Golem Cloud](https://github.com/golemcloud) created a new project [moonbit-component-generator](https://github.com/golemcloud/moonbit-component-generator), a Rust library embedding the MoonBit compiler for programmatically generating MoonBit source code and compiling it into WebAssembly components. The library is entirely self-contained with no external dependencies, supporting multiple use cases exposed through crate features, such as generating WASM components containing arbitrary strings and components implementing typed configuration. This is a well-documented, high-quality pioneering project.
- MoonBit official member [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) developed a project [mbti_inspector](https://github.com/moonbit-community/mbti_inspector) under the MoonBit Community organization—a CLI tool that queries methods and `trait impl` for types within MBTI, providing review support for [core](https://github.com/moonbitlang/core) developers. 
- The MoonBit Summer of Open Source project [jade-ui](https://github.com/moonbit-community/jade-ui) initiated by [oboard](https://github.com/moonbit-community/jade-ui) is a MoonBit UI library for building web applications, based on [rabbit-tea](https://github.com/moonbit-community/rabbit-tea).
- [Hank HCHogan](https://github.com/HCHogan) created [Moongle](https://github.com/HCHogan/moongle), inspired by the renowned Haskell community project [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org), enabling API search within MoonBit packages. The project is currently in early stages.
- [Hank HCHogan](https://github.com/HCHogan) developed a Haskell binding for MoonBit Tree Sitter [haskell-tree-sitter-moonbit](https://github.com/HCHogan/haskell-tree-sitter-moonbit), simplifying MoonBit code parsing in Haskell.
- [zhangweijun Zhang-WJ](https://github.com/Zhang-WJ) implemented a simple frontend example [cmark-frontend-example](https://github.com/Zhang-WJ/cmark-frontend-example) using [cmark.mbt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/cmark.mbt), demonstrating frontend application development with cmark.mbt or OCaml.
- [Morphir](https://github.com/finos/morphir) is an IR and toolchain/framework for abstracting business logic. [Eleven19](https://github.com/Eleven19) built a [MoonBit implementation](https://github.com/Eleven19/morphir-moonbit) of Morphir, currently in early stages but representing fascinating work.
- [Congcong Cai HerrCai0907](https://github.com/HerrCai0907) conducted a [Benchmark](https://github.com/HerrCai0907/moonbit-for-OO-bench) comparing MoonBit, AssemblyScript, and Native (C++) under OOP conditions. Results show MoonBit outperforms AssemblyScript in limited scenarios, achieving near-parity performance with AssemblyScript when using Binaryen + WasmGC.
- [Gasai ジェリー gasacchi](https://github.com/gasacchi) implemented a programming language called [Glimpse](https://github.com/gasacchi/glimpse) in MoonBit, having completed the Lexer component.
