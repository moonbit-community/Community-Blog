title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- [Community-Blog](https://github.com/moonbit-community/community-blog), built based on [Kodama](https://github.com/kokic/kodama) and led by [Lampese 东灯](https://github.com/Lampese) from Team J139 of the PLCT Lab at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was officially open-sourced this week and is now accepting community contributions to express the community's voice and promote community development. It is now accessible at https://moonbit.community.
- MoonBit official team member [Yu Zhang](https://github.com/Yu-zh) has written a text editor [Tuzi](https://github.com/Yu-zh/Tuzi) using MoonBit. This is an interesting attempt at developing a CLI application using MoonBit Native.
- MoonBit official team member [tonyfettes](https://github.com/tonyfettes) has open-sourced the repository [tree-sitter support for MoonBit Interface (.mbt) files](https://github.com/tonyfettes/tree-sitter-mbti). This is related to the official support for highlighting this file type in the past two weeks.
- MoonBit official team member [tonyfettes](https://github.com/tonyfettes) has created a Linter tool for MoonBit, [moon-lint](https://github.com/tonyfettes/moon-lint), which was also introduced at the Meetup on March 30. This tool is based on tree-sitter and currently can perform some linting tasks that do not require static semantic analysis.
- MoonBit official team member [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) has written a diff tool for MoonBit code, [mbtdiff](https://github.com/myfreess/mbtdiff). This diff tool is built using the MoonBit Native backend and can be used in the command line. In the future, it may improve the effectiveness of LLM for MoonBitCode.
- [Ranhao Kang](https://github.com/RanhaoKang) has created a project [moonbit-unity](https://github.com/RanhaoKang/moonbit-unity) that attempts to use MoonBit for programming in the [Unity](https://unity.com) game framework. The compilation process is: MoonBit -> JS backend -> PuerTS -> Unity. This project is an interesting exploration of MoonBit's horizontal expansion.
- [Oboard](https://github.com/oboard) has written an [mbx compiler](https://github.com/oboard/mbx-compiler). He proposed an mbx syntax similar to jsx/tsx, which allows HTML tags to be embedded in MoonBit code and supports compilation to the [rabbit-tea](https://github.com/Yoorkin/rabbit-tea) syntax. This library is a cutting-edge attempt at developing frontend applications using MoonBit.
- [colmugx](https://github.com/colmugx) has created an experimental project [moonbit-zig-experimental](https://github.com/colmugx/moonbit-zig-experimental) that implements an HTTP client using Zig and MoonBit.
- [Hyrious](https://github.com/hyrious) has developed MoonBit syntax highlighting and LSP support for the [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) editor, [now open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/hyrious/moonbit-syntax-highlight/).
- [quirk-lab](https://github.com/quirk-lab) has written [Zed plugin support](https://github.com/quirk-lab/zed-moonbit) for MoonBit.
