- Best Frontier Innovation in Hard Tech Award

  On March 29, the 12th Open-Source Operating System Annual Technical Conference ([OS2ATC](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jo3EnoUAXkvkU6XKG1IFwA)) was successfully held at Beihang University. OS2ATC brought together leading experts and industry pioneers from top institutions including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Ant Group, Tencent Cloud, National Innovation Center of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles, and China Mobile IoT.

  MoonBit reshapes the programming language ecosystem through groundbreaking technological innovations:

  - Wasm-native accelerated compilation toolchain and LLVM backend architecture, boosting code execution efficiency multiple times to empower cloud computing, edge computing, and AI scenarios;
  - Deep support for the RISC-V instruction set;
  - Integration of industry and academia, implemented in Peking University's curriculum system;

  Through these technical practices, MoonBit validated the benchmark value of hard tech "transitioning from academia to industry", establishing core foundations for the cloud-native and intelligent computing era, and was honored with the Best Frontier Innovation in Hard Tech Award!

- WASM I/O 2025

  This week, MoonBit made its debut at the Barcelona [WASM I/O Conference](https://wasm.io) and delivered a technical presentation. This marked the first appearance of a Chinese developer platform at this international technology summit, showcasing the innovative achievements of domestic open-source forces in the WASM ecosystem. During the event, Zhang Hongbo, Lead of MoonBit, delivered a keynote speech titled "[MoonBit & WebAssembly: Unlocking the True Efficiency of Wasm](https://2025.wasm.io/sessions/moonbit-and-webassembly-unlocking-the-true-efficiency-of-wasm)". The community highly praised MoonBit's performance: Zalim, creator of Kotlin/Wasm, stated on social media: "MoonBit has achieved brilliant results on the WebAssembly platform," recognizing MoonBit's technical accomplishments in WASM. John A De Goes, CEO of ZivergeTech & Golem Cloud, also remarked: "After meeting Zhang Hongbo at WASM I/O, I am even more excited about MoonBit's future!"

- Mooncakes Open-Sourced

  Led by MoonBit's official contributor [Yoorkin](https://github.com/Yoorkin) with contributions from [Lampese](https://github.com/Lampese), the new version of the mooncakes.io website has been [open-sourced under the moonbitlang organization](https://github.com/moonbitlang/mooncakes.io). Built entirely in MoonBit using the [rabbit-tea](https://github.com/Yoorkin/rabbit-tea) framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), this website serves as an excellent example of developing multi-page applications with MoonBit. The official mooncakes.io site has already adopted this new implementation.

  Notably, this new version of mooncakes.io incorporates two community repositories: [fuzz-match](https://github.com/moonbit-community/fuzzy_match) for search functionality and [lazy](https://github.com/CAIMEOX/lazy/blob/main/src/lazy.mbt) for lazy evaluation.
