title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [justjavac Midu](https://github.com/justjavac) created a new repository [moonbit-bytesize](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-bytesize), a Byte Count Representations Wrapper. It references Rust's [bytesize/bytesize](https://github.com/bytesize-rs/bytesize) library.
- [justjavac Midu](https://github.com/justjavac) created a new repository [moonbit-itoa](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-itoa), a fast integer-to-string conversion library inspired by Rust's [itoa](https://github.com/dtolnay/itoa) library.
- [justjavac Midu](https://github.com/justjavac) created a new repository [moonbit-btoi](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-btoi), a library for parsing integers from ASCII Byte Arrays, inspired by Rust's [btoi](https://github.com/niklasf/rust-btoi) library.
- [justjavac Midu](https://github.com/justjavac) created a new repository [moonbit-num-cpus](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-num-cpus). This cross-platform library retrieves the number of available CPU cores on the system, supporting both logical and physical core detection. It represents one of the rare hardware-related infrastructure packages in the MoonBit community.
- [ryota0624](https://github.com/ryota0624) developed a Wasm Protobuf library [moonbit-protobuf-wasm](https://github.com/ryota0624/moonbit-protobuf-wasm). This project provides MoonBit Protobuf Bindings and is currently in its early development stage with documentation still lacking.
- [0Ayachi0](https://github.com/0Ayachi0) developed an efficient Merkle Tree implementation library [MerkleTree](https://github.com/0Ayachi0/MerkleTree). It supports creating trees, generating proofs, and verifying proofs. The library offers advanced features such as custom hash functions, multi-proof verification, and odd-node handling. The only current drawback is its incomplete API documentation.
