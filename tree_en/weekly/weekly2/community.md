title: Community Updates This Week
---

- This week, [illusory0x0 猗露](https://github.com/illusory0x0) authored three articles in Community-Blog: [MoonBit Implementation of Tree Preorder Traversal](/blog/iterator/preorder-traversal), [MoonBit Implementation of External Iterator](/blog/iterator/external), and [MoonBit Implementation of Internal Iterator](blog/iterator/internal). The first article serves as a prerequisite, while the latter two form the main body. Starting from the basics, they introduce iterators, elaborate on the distinctions between the two types, and implement both the algorithms and iterators using MoonBit.

- This week, [CAIMEOX](https://github.com/CAIMEOX) contributed an article titled [Derive Iteration from Recursion](/blog/defunctionalize/index) to Community-Blog. Using examples, it thoroughly explores the concept of defunctionalization and its implementation in MoonBit.
