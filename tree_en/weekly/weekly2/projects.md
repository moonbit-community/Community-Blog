title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- [colmugx](https://github.com/colmugx) developed a project called [NTM (Node Tool in MoonBit)](https://github.com/colmugx/ntm) using MoonBit. This tool implements a NodeJS version management utility with MoonBit Native backend and is currently in the experimental stage.
- [Glenn Lewis](https://github.com/gmlewis) created a simple abstraction project for MCP: [moonbit-mcp](https://github.com/gmlewis/moonbit-mcp). It's worth noting that MoonBit official member [peter-jerry-ye Zihang Ye](https://github.com/peter-jerry-ye) previously developed a [MCP Server SDK](https://github.com/peter-jerry-ye/mcp-server) for MoonBit.
- [Bingque](https://github.com/bingque) initiated a new project [mongobit](https://github.com/bingque/mongobit), aiming to build an application framework for Web, mobile, and mini-program platforms using MoonBit. However, no code has been submitted yet.
