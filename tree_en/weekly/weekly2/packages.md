- [illusory0x0 猗露](https://github.com/illusory0x0) developed a [classic adapton implementation](https://github.com/moonbit-community/adapton.mbt) based on MoonBit, supporting lazy evaluation and dependency graph-driven incremental computation. In this system, set operations do not immediately trigger updates; instead, they mark nodes as Dirty. Updates are only propagated through the dependency graph and necessary computations are performed when get is called. The dependency graph is automatically built during the first call to Thunk::get and uses a global stack to track dependencies. The implementation also supports node memoization to handle scenarios with dynamically changing dependency structures, such as spreadsheet applications. Note that due to the current lack of weak reference features in MoonBit, memory leaks may occur, especially when memoization is enabled.
- [kesmeey](https://github.com/kesmeey) developed a library implementing two main data structures: [IndexSet](https://github.com/moonbit-community/IndexSet) and [IndexMap](https://github.com/moonbit-community/IndexMap). They are fully compatible with all operations of the [HashSet library](https://github.com/moonbitlang/core/tree/main/hashset) and [HashMap library](https://github.com/moonbitlang/core/tree/main/hashmap) from [MoonBit Core](https://github.com/moonbitlang/core). Currently, it supports operations such as creation, addition, querying, sorting, traversal, set operations, and indexed access. This package is now largely complete, and feedback is welcome.
- [GreatHank](https://github.com/GreatHank) developed a mutable version of the [BitVector library](https://github.com/GreatHank/moonbit-BitVector), implementing representation, storage, and common operations for bit vectors, including setting/clearing/flipping bits, bit counting, logical operations, range extraction, and serialization. It has currently passed the first stage certification of the PLCT laboratory's output.
- MoonBit's official team member [Yu-zh Yu Zhang](https://github.com/Yu-zh) developed a terminal operation library [termbit](https://github.com/Yu-zh/termbit). The project is inspired by [corssterm-rs](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm). This package is still under development and has only been tested on Mac chips.
- MoonBit's official team member [NSlash951 myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) developed a [SQLite3 Binding](https://github.com/myfreess/sqlite3.mbt) for the MoonBit Native backend. It is currently in the early stages of development.
