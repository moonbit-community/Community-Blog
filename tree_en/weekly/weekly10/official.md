title: This Week's Official Highlights
---

- The **2025 MoonBit Global Programming Innovation Challenge (MGPIC 2025)** is now officially open for registration. MGPIC 2025 is a professional competition for developers worldwide. The inaugural 2024 edition attracted over 1,888 teams from renowned institutions including Tsinghua University, University of Cambridge, Sun Yat-sen University, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Honorary judges included Harry Shum, Lin Huimin, Zhao Chen, and Ni Mingxuan, garnering widespread attention and recognition from both academia and industry. This year's competition retains two tracks—Game Development and Compiler Design—but introduces richer and more diverse formats. Details are available in the [official announcement](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8IbEQ0dasvQlIMeAgJhHww).  
- In late July 2025, MoonBit launched **Moon Pilot**, the world’s first bottom-up code intelligence agent. As highlighted in the announcement by IDEA Research: "Through an AI-native reconstruction from language to toolchain, MoonBit Pilot—developed by IDEA’s Fundamental Software Center—creates a development environment deeply integrated with large models. It surpasses existing tools like Cursor in code generation quality and large-scale refactoring efficiency, presenting the first engineering prototype of L4 software delivery capability without human intervention."
