title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- MoonBit official developer [Kaida-Amethyst](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst) created a Godot binding for MoonBit called [godot.mbt](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/godot.mbt), enabling developers to build games using MoonBit with the Godot engine. The project has completed the mapping from GDExtension to MoonBit types. Further abstraction awaits updates to MoonBit's language features, so development is currently paused.  
- MoonBit official developer [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) developed a new game framework [selene](https://github.com/Milky2018/selene), currently in its early stages. This framework will be used for tutorial development in the MGPIC 2025 game track.  
- [hanbings](https://github.com/hanbings) created a new database project [chongming](https://github.com/hanbings/chongming), an LSM Tree-based NoSQL database implemented in MoonBit. Core algorithms and data structures including xxhash, murmur3, Bloom filter, and skip list are complete. Future work includes BSON and SQL parsing, with plans to build a distributed system based on the Raft algorithm.  
- [Thomas Gorny trival](https://github.com/trival) built an experimental WebGPU project [moon-webgpu-test](https://github.com/trival/moon-webgpu-test) that compiles to JavaScript. It demonstrates using MoonBit's FFI to interface with WebGPU APIs and render a classic RGB triangle.  
- [Nathan Soufflet nathsou](https://github.com/nathsou) developed a hardware description language project [yodl](https://github.com/nathsou/yodl), an alternative HDL written in MoonBit. It supports FIRRTL export, multi-port memories, module parameters, type parameters, and provides a full toolchain including simulation, testbenches, and KiCad schematic export.  
- [Nathan Soufflet nathsou](https://github.com/nathsou) created a simple 16-bit load-store CPU project [cpu16](https://github.com/nathsou/cpu16), featuring ISA design, a Rust simulator, and Yodl implementation. It implements the full CPU16 instruction set with control flags, register operations, memory access, and ALU operations. FPGA deployment is supported for Nexys A7 boards.  
- [Zhehao 0xFF KCN-judu](https://github.com/KCN-judu) initiated [luna_engine](https://github.com/KCN-judu/luna_engine), a 2D game engine based on [rabbit-tea](https://github.com/moonbit-community/rabbit-tea), currently in early development.  
- [oboard](https://github.com/oboard) built an interactive interpreter for MoonBit [moonbit-repl](https://github.com/oboard/moonbit-repl), providing REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) functionality. Based on [moonbit-eval](https://github.com/oboard/moonbit-eval), it supports both Native and Node.js backends.  
- [papo1011](https://github.com/papo1011) developed a MoonBit-to-LLVM compiler [drakoon](https://github.com/papo1011/drakoon) written in Rust. It supports core MoonBit features including primitive types (Int, Double, Unit), arrays, variable declarations, constants, arithmetic/relational operators, control flow (if/for/while), function definitions, and emits LLVM IR.  
- [schwarz](https://github.com/schwarz) created a MoonBit version of the Gilded Rose Kata refactoring exercise [gilded-rose-moonbit](https://github.com/schwarz/gilded-rose-moonbit). This classic challenge tasks developers with improving legacy code and adding features. The project models an inventory system with quality decay rules for diverse item types, offering excellent practice for MoonBit developers.  
- [moonbit-community](https://github.com/moonbit-community) developed MoonBit language support for Helix editor [moonbit.helix](https://github.com/moonbit-community/moonbit.helix). It provides full integration including syntax highlighting, LSP configuration, code formatting, tree-sitter-moonbit parsing, `.mbt` file support, and `moon.mod.json` project root detection.  
- To accommodate the anticipated surge of game projects for MGPIC 2025, game-specific entries will be aggregated at the bottom of "New High-Quality Community Projects" from this issue until the competition concludes. Since many compilation track projects are not open-source and lack significant exposition value, they won't have a dedicated section.  
    - MoonBit official team developed a 2D side-scrolling platformer [pixel-adventure.mbt](https://github.com/moonbitlang/pixel-adventure.mbt) with pixel art style, playable in web browsers. It features complete systems including character control, collision detection, level generation, and rendering â€“ serving as a comprehensive MoonBit game example.  
    - [Great Love League](https://github.com/Great-Love-League) created a MoonBit stickman physics game [stickman-adventure](https://github.com/Great-Love-League/stickman-adventure) using FFI to integrate the Matter.js engine.
