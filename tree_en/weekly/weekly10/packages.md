title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- MoonBit founder [Hongbo Zhang](https://github.com/bobzhang) developed a MoonBit iterator visitor pattern library [moonbit-visitors](https://github.com/bobzhang/moonbit-visitors), demonstrating an elegant implementation for traversing and processing expression trees in MoonBit. This library provides automatic tree traversal capabilities, allowing developers to override only specific behaviors as needed. It implements a design pattern that minimizes boilerplate code and includes comprehensive tests and documentation.
- [Thomas Gorny trival](https://github.com/trival) created a linear algebra library for MoonBit [moon-graphics-tests](https://github.com/trival/moon-graphics-tests). The library features a dual-implementation architecture supporting runtime vector math computations and WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) code generation. It supports Vec2 and Vec3 operations including arithmetic, dot products, cross products, normalization, and more.
- [CGaaaaaa](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa) developed a reactive programming library for MoonBit [Reactivex](https://github.com/CGaaaaaa/reactivex). This library provides Observable sequences and rich operators for composing asynchronous and event-based programs. Implemented based on the ReactiveX specification, it includes usage examples though documentation requires further improvement.
- MoonBit core team member [tonyfettes](https://github.com/tonyfettes) created a PCRE2 binding library for MoonBit [pcre2.mbt](https://github.com/tonyfettes/pcre2.mbt), enabling access to the PCRE2 regex library. Using FFI (Foreign Function Interface) technology to bind the PCRE2 C library, it adds powerful text processing capabilities to the MoonBit ecosystem.
- [ZSeanYves](https://github.com/ZSeanYves) developed a lightweight BSON codec library [MoonbitBSON](https://github.com/moonbit-community/MoonbitBSON), supporting serialization/deserialization of core elements including BSON documents, arrays, strings, integers, booleans, and null values. It offers a composable API for BSON construction and traversal. API documentation is currently unwritten.
- [edragain](https://github.com/edragain2nd) built a library for parsing and writing BibTeX/BibLaTeX files [Biblatex-moonbit](https://github.com/edragain2nd/Biblatex-moonbit). Based on the Rust implementation rust-biblatex, it parses .bib files into usable structs and enums (e.g., Person, Date) with automatic type conversion and alias handling for fields like authors and dates. API documentation needs improvement.
- [oboard](https://github.com/oboard) developed a readline library for MoonBit [readline](https://github.com/oboard/readline), providing cross-backend, callback-based input processing.
- [AXiX AXiX-official](https://github.com/AXiX-official) implemented xxHash for MoonBit [mbt-xxhash](https://github.com/AXiX-official/mbt-xxhash), supporting both xxHash32 and xxHash64. Documentation requires further completion.
- MoonBit core team member [myfreess](https://github.com/myfreess) created a semantic diff comparison library [rwsdiff.mbt](https://github.com/myfreess/rwsdiff.mbt) for comparing and displaying semantic differences in code/text. Currently in early development.
- [Asterless](https://github.com/Asterless) developed a high-performance QOI image codec library [MoonQOI](https://github.com/Asterless/MoonQOI), fully compliant with the Quite OK Image format specification. It supports all QOI opcodes, RGB/RGBA channels, sRGB/linear color spaces, and provides an easy-to-use API for rapid image compression/decompression scenarios.
- [chaijie2018](https://github.com/chaijie2018) created a Bloom filter library [bloom](https://github.com/chaijie2018/bloom), inspired by Go's bloom package. It offers concise set representation with membership queries, uses murmurhash, and allows specifying desired capacity/false-positive ratesâ€”ideal for efficient set membership checks.
- MoonBit founder [Hongbo Zhang](https://github.com/bobzhang) developed an INI configuration parser [ini-parser](https://github.com/bobzhang/ini-parser). MoonBit can now parse most common configuration file formats.
