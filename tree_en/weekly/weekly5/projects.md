title: High-Quality New Projects in the Community This Week
---

- MoonBit core team member [Kaida-Amethyst](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst) developed [TinyMoonBit](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/TinyMoonbit), an extremely simplified MoonBit-like language compiler project with complexity comparable to that of the C language. This project serves as a comprehensive educational example for the [llvm.mbt](https://github.com/moonbitlang/llvm.mbt) LLVM binding project and the LLVM-inspired project [Aether](https://github.com/Kaida-Amethyst/Aether), demonstrating how to develop an LLVM IR-generating compiler using MoonBit. 2025/6/17 04:22  
- [Lampese Dong Deng](https://github.com/Lampese), [Li Boyuan](https://github.com/LilJordan23), and [Deng Zihui](https://github.com/orgs/WKU-LLM-Collections/people/dengjihui1) from Wenzhou-Kean University launched two new projects: [Mooncakes-Judger](https://github.com/WKU-MoonBit-AI-Collections/Mooncakes-Judger) and [clean-mooncakes.io](https://mooncakes.moonbit-community.com). The former uses LLM to determine whether projects on mooncakes.io should be blacklisted, while the latter displays a "cleaner mooncakes" by filtering content using the former project's blacklist. This project will significantly aid future LLM prompt engineering.  
- [ShellWen Jie Wen](https://github.com/ShellWen) created an experimental HTTP server [sw-http-server](https://github.com/moonbit-community/sw-http-server) based on nix socket bindings, derived from their new project [sw-socket](https://github.com/moonbit-community/sw-socket). Currently in early development, it already has a runnable demo.  
- [KCN-judu](https://github.com/KCN-judu) from the [LunaFlow](https://github.com/Luna-Flow) team developed a Sudoku solver demo [Sudoku](https://github.com/KCN-judu/Sudoku) using the [LunaFlow](https://github.com/Luna-Flow) library series. Though lacking complete documentation, it features a previewable and intriguing demo.  
- [FrenchPicnic](https://github.com/FrenchPicnic) built a cross-platform Native Which utility [which-mbt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/which-mbt), now fully operational. This project demonstrates a successful implementation of command-line tools using MoonBit.  
- MoonBit core team member [peter-jerry-ye Zihang Ye](https://github.com/peter-jerry-ye) released [canvas](https://github.com/peter-jerry-ye/canvas), an experimental Canvas binding library for the MoonBit JS backend, featuring a runnable counter demo.  
- MoonBit core team member [tonyfettes Haoxiang Fei](https://github.com/tonyfettes) published a [Flatpak SDK](https://github.com/tonyfettes/org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.moonbit) for MoonBit, enabling MoonBit program execution within Flatpak environments.  
- MoonBit founder [Prof. Zhang Hongbo](https://github.com/bobzhang) utilized MoonAgent to generate an experimental sexp parser project [lisp-machine-MoonPilot](https://github.com/bobzhang/lisp-machine-MoonPilot), demonstrating MoonAgent's capability in large-scale projects.  
- [A-23187](https://github.com/A-23187) created a tree-based syntax-and-semantics-aware code chunker for RAG-based code segmentation.  
- [Kresna Sucandra SHA888](https://github.com/SHA888) built [TMDash](https://github.com/SHA888/TMDash), a web-based telemedicine platform using MoonBit. Leveraging WebAssembly (WASM), it delivers high-performance and AI-native capabilities for smart health data processing. The dashboard provides real-time video/chat communication, health data visualization, appointment management, and AI-driven insights for patients and healthcare providers.
