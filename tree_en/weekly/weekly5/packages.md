title: This Week's New High-Quality Community Packages
---

- [illusory0x0 (Yi Lu)](https://github.com/illusory0x0) open-sourced a new package [simple_parserc](https://github.com/moonbit-community/simple_parserc), a simple Monadic Parser Combinator library. With relatively high completion, it's a noteworthy library for symbolic computation in MoonBit.
- [BigOrangeQWQ](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ) developed a new formatting utility library [fmt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/fmt) (Note: Although there are many existing ones in the community, new attempts deserve encouragement). It features well-implemented code and documentation, with API design inspired by Python's `str.format`.
- [kesmeey](https://github.com/kesmeey) created a new library [immut_IntervalTree](https://github.com/moonbit-community/immut_IntervalTree), an immutable interval tree library with high current completion. The mutable version was also previously developed by this contributor.
- MoonBit officially created an officially supported regex library [regexp.mbt](https://github.com/moonbitlang/regexp.mbt) within the organization. It offers more comprehensive functionality than previous community-maintained regex libraries and includes thorough documentation.
- Veteran developer [justjavac (Mi Du)](https://github.com/justjavac) built [moonbit-webview](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-webview), a MoonBit-based WebView binding project. It has reached high completion with a functional WebView demo. He concurrently developed an FFI utility library [moonbit-ffi](https://github.com/justjavac/moonbit-ffi) for this project.
- [ShellWen (Jie Wen)](https://github.com/ShellWen) authored [sw-socket](https://github.com/moonbit-community/sw-socket), a robust socket handling library with high code quality and comprehensive documentation. He demonstrated its usage in the demo project [sw-http-server](https://github.com/moonbit-community/sw-http-server).
- [AdUhTkJm (Yue Huang)](https://github.com/AdUhTkJm) developed [nummoon](https://github.com/AdUhTkJm/nummoon), a high-performance numerical library supporting SIMD. It features extensive documentation and benchmarks, making it a significant contribution to numerical computing in MoonBit.
- [bikallem](https://github.com/bikallem) created [Reactive](https://github.com/bikallem/reactive), a reactive programming library for MoonBit. With solid code quality and documentation, it can already build simple demos.
- [TheWaWaR (LinFeng)](https://github.com/TheWaWaR) developed a new command parser [clap.mbt](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/clap.mbt) (Note: While community alternatives exist, they couldn't handle complex tasks). It now supports advanced parsing, outputs detailed command information, and is production-ready.
- [BigOrangeQWQ](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ) built the [UnificationTable](https://github.com/BigOrangeQWQ/UnificationTable) library to solve algebraic simplification problems in symbolic computation.
- [wangjuwudi](https://github.com/wangjuwudi) from [LunaFlow](https://github.com/Luna-Flow) team created [Linear-Program](https://github.com/wangjuwudi/Linear-program) for solving linear programming problems. It currently implements LP problem definition and standardization.
- [MINGtoMING (Zhenming Lin)](https://github.com/MINGtoMING) developed [simdstring.mbt](https://github.com/MINGtoMING/simdstring.mbt), a SIMD-accelerated string library for native backends. With decent completion, it supports basic string operations.
- MoonBit core developer [NSlash951 (myfrees)](https://github.com/myfreess) open-sourced [propagator](https://github.com/myfreess/propagator). Propagator algorithms solve constraint propagation problems, previously used in critical medical treatment scenarios.
- [illusory0x0 (Yi Lu)](https://github.com/illusory0x0) created [clonembt](https://github.com/illusory0x0/clone.mbt) to address memory issues in RC environments. It ensures data safety in native multi-threaded contexts, preventing RC modification races even with immutable containers.
- [33761](https://github.com/33761) developed a MoonBit binding for Raylib [raylib-mbt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/raylib-mbt). Currently incomplete, it shows promising API design.
- [Milky2018](https://github.com/Milky2018) built [moonlight](https://github.com/Milky2018/moonlight), a distributed computing engine for MoonBit. Though documentation is pending, substantial code exists.
- [FrenchPicnic](https://github.com/FrenchPicnic) initiated [crypto.mbt](https://github.com/moonbit-community/crypto.mbt) in MoonBit-Community to supplement missing algorithms in official crypto. Currently empty. Note: Active community member [Glenn Lewis](https://github.com/gmlewis) may have similar libraries.
- MoonBit core developer [NSlash951 (myfrees)](https://github.com/myfreess) open-sourced [intmap](https://github.com/myfreess/intmap), containing functional data structures.
- MoonBit core developer [NSlash951 (myfrees)](https://github.com/myfreess) created [asm.mbt](https://github.com/myfreess/asm.mbt), using FFI to interface with Assembly. It dynamically generates machine code on x86 devices for in-memory executionâ€”an intriguing hardware simulation attempt.
- [CAIMEO](http) developed [svg](https://github.com/CAIMEOX/svg), an SVG library for MoonBit. It provides a clean, type-correct approach to construct SVG content, with comprehensive documentation.
