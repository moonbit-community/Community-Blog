title: Basic

Community-Blog is built on the [Kodama](https://github.com/kokic/kodama) 0.2.7 framework,  
supporting both markdown and typst languages with a forest-like structure.  
For detailed usage of this framework, refer to its official [tutorials](https://kokic.github.io/tutorials/).  
In Community-Blog, we believe that basic markdown writing skills and typesetting experience suffice for most scenarios.  
For complex diagramming needs, we recommend using Typst for rendering.  
Contributing to Community-Blog is straightforward:  
Simply submit a Pull Request to our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/moonbit-community/community-blog).  
**Writing specifications** will be introduced later in this document.
