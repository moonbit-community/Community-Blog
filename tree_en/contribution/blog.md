Community members are welcome to freely contribute blog posts covering MoonBit tutorials, technical discussions, development diaries, and related topics.  
Simply initiate a PR to add articles in the `trees/blog` directory. Since articles may require multiple files for section organization,  
authors are advised to create a dedicated folder for each article and use a main file to include other components.  
Each article must include the following metadata in its header:

- `author`: The author's name
- `date`: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `title`: Article title
- `taxon`: Article category (typically `Blog`)

Example:

```md

author: CAIMEOX
date: 2025-04-01
title: MoonBit 开发日记
taxon: Blog
---
```
