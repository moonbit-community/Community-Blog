title: Simple segment tree implementation in MoonBit

The following code shows a simple segment tree implementation in MoonBit, which uses some utility functions for handling index ranges, as shown in Figure 8. We store the segment tree as a recursive algebraic data type. We implement `update` and `rq` with code that directly corresponds to the recursive description in the previous section; then, `get` and `set` can also be implemented based on them. It is not difficult to generalize this code to a segment tree that stores values from any commutative monoid (if the `set` operation is not needed) or any abelian group (i.e., a commutative monoid with inverses, if the `set` operation is needed) â€” but for simplicity, we leave it as is, because such generalization does not add to our main story.
