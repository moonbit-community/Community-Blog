To my knowledge, Fenwick trees were not historically developed as optimizations of segment trees in the manner presented in this article. The narrative here is merely a fictional alternative history of ideas (though hopefully insightful), aiming to demonstrate the power of functional thinking, domain-specific languages, and equational reasoning in exploring relationships between different structures and algorithms. As future work, it would be an interesting endeavor to explore certain generalizations of segment trees mentioned earlier and investigate whether Fenwick-like structures supporting additional operations could be derived from them.
