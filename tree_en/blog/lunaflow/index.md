<!-- Overview -->

LunaFlow is a scientific computing framework based on MoonBit,
designed to provide users with efficient and flexible computational capabilities.
The framework exhibits numerous unique aspects in its design philosophy,
particularly evident in its implementation of data abstraction and generic algorithms.
Regrettably, comprehensive technical documentation detailing the theoretical foundations and practical trade-offs behind these core designs has been lacking.

As one of the architects of LunaFlow, the author writes this article with two primary objectives:
First, to systematically dissect LunaFlow's top-level design philosophy, revealing its core design principles and implementation details.
Second, to demonstrate through empirical analysis of concrete use cases how to leverage this framework to build efficient numerical computation workflows.
It is hoped that readers will not only appreciate the ingenuity of such abstract design in engineering practice,
but also migrate this paradigm to their own project development, enhancing code expressiveness and versatility.
